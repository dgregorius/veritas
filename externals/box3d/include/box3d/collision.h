 * @defgroup tree Dynamic Tree
 * The dynamic tree is a binary AABB tree to organize and query large numbers of geometric objects
 *
 * Box2D uses the dynamic tree internally to sort collision shapes into a binary bounding volume hierarchy.
 * This data structure may have uses in games for organizing other geometry data and may be used independently
 * of Box2D rigid body simulation.
 *
 * A dynamic AABB tree broad-phase, inspired by Nathanael Presson's btDbvt.
 * A dynamic tree arranges data in a binary tree to accelerate
 * queries such as AABB queries and ray casts. Leaf nodes are proxies
 * with an AABB. These are used to hold a user collision object.
 * Nodes are pooled and relocatable, so I use node indices rather than pointers.
 * The dynamic tree is made available for advanced users that would like to use it to organize
 * spatial game data besides rigid bodies.
